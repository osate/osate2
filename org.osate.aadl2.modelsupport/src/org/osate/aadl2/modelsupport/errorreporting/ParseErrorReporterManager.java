 * This class manages the creation and use of

 * that ensures each reporter is "cleared" only the first time it is retreived.
 * Also coordinates errors counts across a set of parsed files. This class used
 * to have more functionality that is now rolled into
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.AnalysisToParseErrorReporterAdapter}.

/**
 * Working replacement for {@link #AaxlReadOnlyHandlerAsJob}.  Not at all "ready for prime-time", which
 * is why it is currently package visibility.  Also consider integrating with
 * {@code org.osate.ui.handlers.AbstractMultiJobHandler}.
 *
 * Assumptions: The analysis selection is a bunch of working sets, AADL projects, folders, and aaxl files.
 * There is a method for getting a list of unique aaxl files from that.  IT is assumed analysis can
 * run on each aaxl file independently.  Analysis may produce markers on each aaxl file, and may create a
 * single output file for each input aaxl file.  For each input file, the output file is located
 * in "reports/subdir/" rooted in the same directory as the input file.  The analysis names "subdir"
 * using an abstract method.  The output file is named using an abstract method.
 *
 * We need more experience writing some "modern" osate analyses.  I'm sure this draft class will
 * need to be modified further.  It's possible we will find some analysis that doesn't fit
 * the assumptions at all.

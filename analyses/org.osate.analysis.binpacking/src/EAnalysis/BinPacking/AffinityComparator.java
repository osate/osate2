 * 
 * This is a comparator to be used only when the connectivity and bandwidth
 * between modules is static. If such connectivity is modified the comparator
 * will give the wrong order given that it will cache intermediate results.
 * 
 * This comparator works partitioning the natural order into three components:
 * affinity of current node affinity of neighboring nodes and capacity. The
 * affinity parts has an order of magnitud larger value than the capacity. What
 * this effectively means is that we let the capacity difference range from -1
 * to 1, the affinity of current node difference range from -100 to 100, and the
 * affinitiy of neighboring nodes range from -10 to 10

# Check Binding Constraints
The objective of this plug-in is to check that a model conforms to various constraints specified in binding properties.

# Invoking the Analysis
 * Select an instance model in the **AADL Navigator**
 * In the main menu, select **Analyses** -> **Semantic Checks** -> **Check binding constraints**

![Main Menu Action](images/MainMenuAction.png)

# Results
Any problems that the analysis finds are reported in the **Problems** view:

# List of Checks

## Processor binding is allowed
For each **thread**, **virtual processor**, and **device**, checks that the processor binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Processor_Binding* is allowed by *Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Processor_Binding* if
specified.

## Processor binding classifier is allowed
For each **thread**, **virtual processor**, and **device**, checks that the classifier of the processor binding
specified by *Deployment_Properties::Actual_Processor_Binding* is allowed by
*Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Processor_Binding_Class* if specified.

## Dispatch protocol is allowed
For each **thread**, **virtual processor**, and **device**, checks that the value of
*Thread_Properties::Dispatch_Protocol* is allowed by the processor binding. If the component has value for
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Processor_Binding*, then the processor binding's
*Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Dispatch_Protocol* will be checked against the dispatch protocol of the component.

## Memory binding is allowed
For each **thread**, **device**, **data**, **subprogram**, **processor**, **virtual processor**, **data port**, and
**event data port**, checks that the memory binding specified by *Deployment_Properties::Actual_Memory_Binding* is
allowed by *Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Memory_Binding* if specified.

## Memory binding classifier is allowed
For each **thread**, **device**, **data**, **subprogram**, **processor**, **virtual processor**, **data port**, and
**event data port**, checks that the classifier of the memory binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Memory_Binding* is allowed by *Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Memory_Binding_Class* if
specified.

## Connection binding is allowed
For each **connection** and **virtual bus**, checks that the connection binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Connection_Binding* is allowed by *Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Connection_Binding* if
specified.

## Connection binding classifier is allowed
For each **connection** and **virtual bus**, checks that the classifier of the connection binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Connection_Binding* is allowed by
*Deployment_Properties::Allowed_Connection_Binding_Class* if specified.

## Required connection quality of service is provided
For each **connection** and **virtual bus**, checks that the QoS specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Required_Connection_Quality_Of_Service* is provided by the connection binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Connection_Binding*. A connection binding provides a QoS with the property
*Deployment_Properties::Provided_Connection_Quality_Of_Service*.

## Required virtual bus classifier is provided
For each **connection** and **virtual bus**, checks that the virtual bus classifier specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Required_Virtual_Bus_Class* is provided by the connection binding specified by
*Deployment_Properties::Actual_Connection_Binding*. A connection binding can provide a virtual bus classifier with the
property *Deployment_Properties::Provided_Virtual_Bus_Class*. If a connection binding directly contains virtual bus
subcomponents, then the classifiers of those subcomponents are also provided by the connection binding.

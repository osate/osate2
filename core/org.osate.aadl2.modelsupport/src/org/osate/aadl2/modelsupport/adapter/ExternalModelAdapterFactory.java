/**
 * This class implements an ExternalModelAdapter factory: It attaches an adapter
 * that handles an external model reference. This adapter does not listen to
 * notifications from changes to the Aadl Object model. The adapter is being
 * created through the createAdapter method. This method can be overwritten to
 * create an ExternalModelAdapter with an active notifyChanged method. If a
 * different adapter type is used, the isFactoryForType method must be
 * overwritten as well
 *
 * <p>Does not support {@link #adaptAllNew(Notifier)} because we cannot know
 * all the type keys that might be used to create adapters with this factory.
 * Specifically, the method {@link #adaptAllNew(Notifier)} does nothing, and
 * the helper method {@link AdapterFactoryImpl#createAdapter(Notifier)}
 * always returns an adapter with a <code>null</code> type.

/**
 * Abstract implementation of
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.ErrorReporterManager} that

 * {@link #internalError(String)}, and {@link #getNumInternalErrors()} to
 * another {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.InternalErrorReporter}
 * object. This is done to acheive a sort of "mix-in" implementation, because
 * the {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.ParseErrorReporterManager}
 * and {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.AnalysisErrorReporterManager}
 * in general have quite different (although similar) implementations, although
 * it is likely that in any given environment they will want to share the
 * implementation of the internal error reporter (e.g., to log events to the
 * Eclipse "error" view).

/**
 * This class manages the creation and use of
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.ParseErrorReporter} instances
 * across a set of AADL text file resources. The manager indexes error reporters
 * using the OS specific path name of the file.
 *
 * <P>
 * The manager is supplied with a
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.ParseErrorReporterFactory}
 * instance that is used to create the error reporters.
 *
 * <p>
 * Primary purpose of this class is to serve as a cache of parse error reporters
 * that ensures each reporter is "cleared" only the first time it is retrieved.
 * Also coordinates errors counts across a set of parsed files. This class used
 * to have more functionality that is now rolled into
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.pluginsupport.AnalysisToParseErrorReporterAdapter}.

/**
 * Abstract class for actions button/menu and context menu menu actions that
 * operate on AAXL models. The body of the action is implemented in the
 * {@link #doAaxlAction(IProgressMonitor, Element)} method. The
 * {@link #getMarkerType()} method should also be overridden to return the name
 * of the marker type the analysis should use to report errors. The method
 * {@link #getActionName()} must be implemented to return the name of the
 * analysis job. This name is used by the Eclipse UI when the showing
 * information about the current job, or the list of active jobs, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * The action is invoked in a {@link org.eclipse.core.resources.WorkspaceJob}.
 * As an workspace job, a single workspace event (if any) is sent at the end of
 * the action, and, more importantly, the workspace is locked from the root
 * object. Thus the action has exclusive access to all the models in the
 * workspace. <em>The job is <b>not</b>
 * guaranteed to run in the SWT/UI thread.</em>
 * The user must use
 * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display#asyncExec(java.lang.Runnable)} or
 * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display#syncExec(java.lang.Runnable)} to
 * ensure that dialog boxes (if any) are manipulated in the SWT/UI thread. OSATE
 * provides the convenience class
 * {@link org.osate.ui.dialogs.Dialog} that opens up
 * {@link org.osate.ui.dialogs.Dialog#showInfo(String, String) informative},
 * {@link org.osate.ui.dialogs.Dialog#showWarning(String, String) warning},
 * {@link org.osate.ui.dialogs.Dialog#showError(String, String) error},
 * and
 * {@link org.osate.ui.dialogs.Dialog#askQuestion(String, String) question}
 * dialog boxes using the SWT/UI thread.
 *
 * <p>
 * The body of the action,
 * {@link org.osate.ui.actions.AbstractAaxlHandler#doAaxlAction(IProgressMonitor, Element)}
 * is passed the Eclipse progress monitor and the currently selected Element in
 * the workspace. It is the responsibility of the subclass to initialize and use
 * the progress monitor. That is, at the minimum, the subclass is expected to
 * call
 * {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor#beginTask(java.lang.String, int)}
 * and {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor#done()} on the progress
 * monitor.
 *
 * <p>A long-running analysis should also periodically check if the user
 * has cancelled the operation by polling
 * method. This is best used via the
 * {@link edu.cmu.sei.aadl.model.util.AadlProcessingSwitchWithProgress} subclass
 * that takes a reference to the progress monitor when it is constructed.
 * Traversals can then poll the progress monitor and cancel the traversal if needed within "case" methods by
 * using the method <code>checkIfCancelled</code>. Traversals
 * can also update the progress monitor via
 * {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor#subTask(java.lang.String)}
 * and {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor#worked(int)} from within
 * "case" methods.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the action ends prematurely becuase it is responding to a cancellation
 * request, <code>doAaxlAction</code> should throw an
 * {@link org.eclipse.core.runtime.OperationCanceledException}.

<P>The Open Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE) Online Help utilizes the Eclipse Platformï¿½s help system.  
	This provides for a navigation and search capability of the help content.<BR>

Currently, the online help consists of the User manual, the Reference Manual, documentation on the AADL meta model, and a plug-in development guide for OSATE.  
The content of the reference manual was generated from the draft standard document.
The content of the AADL meta model description was generated from the draft AAADL Meta Model & XML/XMI Interchange Format Annex V0.9.
The plg-in development guide is also available as a separate document.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Standard properties are not found</h3>
<p>
To fix that, you have to add the standard properties again. Right click
on your project or model and select <em>Create/update Predeclared and
Annex Properties</em>, as shown below.
</p>

<h3>Having the hint replace</h3>
<p>
To get the <em>hint template</em>: type the first letter 
of the keywords, e.g. s, then ctrl-space to bring up menue
then select the proper template.  Make sure cursor is immediately after the letter.
(this works for all the keywords but a variation with feature groups or 
 connections is not in the drop down...I cant recall exactly what it is at this point...)
</p>

<h3>Reasons for errors when instantiating models</h3>
<p>
There are the main reasons for having a model that does not instantiate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<strong>Connection between two components that inherit features</strong>: not supported for now. This error
	is triggered when you try to connect two components that inherits the same component (and such, share the
	same inherited features).
</li>
</ul>


<h3>What is the most effective way to fix errors ?</h3>
<p>
In general, start with the most specific error and try to correct it.
</p>

<p> 
Use the outline view to quickly navigate to the component classifier/features/properties by double-clicking
on the component/feature/properties in the outline view.
</p>

<h3>Resetting the AADL perspective</h3>
<p>
Resetting the AADL perspective (e.g. getting all the window panes back to their default position)
 Click on the 'AADL' button in the upper RH corner.
 or
 MenuBar: Window-> Reset Perspective -> Reset the perspective to AADL defaults?-Y
 </p>
 
 
<h3>Correct way to clear Problem markers</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Reinstantiate will get rid of instantiation markers - note, use Instantiate and not reinstantiate Icon
	</li> 
	<li>
		Highlight the marker group, right click, Delete - Yes
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why cannot we use our own AADL_Project file ?</h3>
<p>
Using your own <em>AADL_Project</em> file would conflict with the
files provided by the plug-in. There are possibilities for supporting
that but it would rather impact user experience. On the other hand,
it could be done by following this process:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>Delete the <em>AADL_Project</em> file from the plug-in resources</li>
   <li>Create a new project with your own <em>AADL_Project</em> file (let's call it <em>myproperties</em></li>
   <li>Introduce a dependency between <em>Plugin_Resources</em> and <em>myproperties</em>. 
   To do so, select <em>Plugin_Resources</em>, click on the <em>Project</em> menu and then <em>Properties</em>.
   Finally, in the project references, select <em>myproperties</em>. </li>
</ol>


<h3>Analysis plug-ins does not report anything</h3>
<p>
Make sure you activate the problem view and check that it reports all
information, as described in <a href="plugins/sei.html">this page</a>.
</p>

<h3>Working with the AADL perspective</h3>
<p>
You want to work in the AADL perspective.
You can set it through <em>Open Perspective</em> in the <em>Window</em>
 menu (or in the Perspective toolbar found on the right in the tool bar section).
</em>

<h3>Adding the Xtext Nature</h3>
<p>
You want to make sure your projects have the AADL and Xtext nature enabled.
This should be done automatically when creating an AADL project but you may
need to do that manually.
This is typically indicated by a decorator on the project. You can enable the 
natures in the AADL Navigator by selecting the project and invoking 
<em>Configure</em> in the context menu. 
The Xtext nature drives the auto-build (compilation) process.
</p>

<h3>Viewing and Filtering the Content of the Problems View</h3>
<p>
The Problems view in Eclipse presents markers attached to resources in the workspace. 
(If you do not have the view, you can open it through the menu Window/Show View). 
These markers are tagged as Error, Warning, or Information. 
They carry a message and are associated with location information (to lines or model elements). 
The Markers are also typed and can be sorted and filtered by type.
</p>


<p>
You can specify what the content of the Problems view is by configuring it through 
commands available through a menu (triangle) in the top right of the Problems view.
</p>

<p>
It is useful to select Group by/Type as this will group markers from a particular 
analysis together rather than grouping them by error, warning, info. 
</p>

<p>
It is also useful to Configure content… Users like to set the Scope to 
be On selected element and its children. 
This will cause only the markers of a selected file, folder, or project 
to be shown. You can also define new configurations, where you limit the
type of marker that you want to have included, e.g., only markers of certain 
analyses.
</p>

<h3>Error when installing OpenFTA</h3>
<p>
When installing OpenFTA, you may have an error related to Java. On Windows 7, you have
to right-click on the installer and change the compatibility options and check,
make sure to execute the software under the Windows 2000 compatibility mode.
The picture below shows the dialog box used to set this property.
</p>

<h3>Tips and trick for editing models</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The AADL text editor does hyperlinking of references. 
	    When you hold down the <Ctrl> key, the test holding 
	    a reference turns into a hyperlink to the reference 
	    model element.
	</li>
	<li>The AADL text editor supports a short-cut for 
	    commenting out multiple lines of AADL text. 
	    Select the lines and type ctrl-/ to comment or 
	    uncomment the selected lines.
	</li>
	<li>The AADL text editor supports context sensitive help.
	    When you pause (hover) over a model element a callout 
	    pops up. When you type <Ctrl><space> a list of suggestions 
	    pops up. For example, in an empty file you can type p and 
	    then <Ctrl><space>. The popup will offer templates for 
	    “package” and “property set”.
	</li>
</ul>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Component types can contain features, flow specifications, 
property associations, and annex

containment associations to <i>Features</i>, <i>FlowSpecs</i>, and through inheritance to <i>AnnexSubclause</i> 
and <i>Properties</i>.&#160; A component type can contain zero or one object of each of these classes, 
and 
zero or more objects in the case of <i>AnnexSubclause</i>.</span></font><span> </span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The <span><i>AnnexSubclause</i> abstract class represents annex subclauses that can

Annex C.4.8).&#160; </span><span></span></div>

existence of such a subclause object provides a distinction between the lack of such a

</ul>
<div align="left">The <span><i>Features </i>class represents the features subclause. It is an abstract 
class with concrete 
subclasses that record category-specific feature limitations. The association is shown as a 
containment association that is specialized for each of the component category-specific concrete 
subclasses of <i>Features</i> (see Annex C.4.7).&#160; Each specialization restricts the containment 
association for a specific component type to its respective <i>Features </i>subclass.&#160; The use 
of the 
same label for the containment association and its specializations permits the contained object to 
be retrieved by subclass-specific methods as well as a generic method of <i>ComponentType</i>.</span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The reference association from the <span><i>ComponentImpl</i> class to the <i>ComponentType</i> 
class is 
specialized for each of the category-specific concrete subclasses of <i>ComponentImpl</i> and 
<i>ComponentType</i>. Each specialization restricts the reference association to the respective category- 
specific subclass (see Annex C.4.4).&#160; The use of the same label for the two ends of the reference 
association and of its specializations permits the referenced objects to be retrieved by subclass- 
specific methods as well as a generic method of the abstract classes.</span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The <span><i>FlowSpecs </i>class represents the flow specifications subclause.&#160; 
It is a concrete class that 
contains individual flow specifications.</span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The <span><i>Properties </i>class represents the properties subclause. It is a concrete 
class that contains 
property associations. Its XML element tag is <i>properties</i>.</span><span></span></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 16 Contents of Component Implementations</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Figure 16</span></font><span> shows the content of a 
component implementation. The <i>ComponentImpl</i> class has 
containment associations to the <i>Subcomponents</i>, <i>RefinesType</i>, <i>Connections</i>, <i>CallSequences</i>, 
<i>Flows</i>, <i>Modes</i> classes, and through inheritance to the <i>AnnexSubclause</i> (see </span><font 
face="Helvetica"><span>Figure 15</span></font><span>) and

one object of each of these classes, 
zero or more objects in the case of <i>AnnexSubclauses</i>.</span></font><span>&#160; </span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The <span><i>Subcomponents </i>class represents the subcomponents subclause. It is 
an abstract class with 
concrete subclasses that record category-specific subcomponent limitations. The association is 
shown as a containment association that is specialized for each of the component category- 
specific concrete subclasses of <i>Subcomponents </i>(see Annex C.4.4).&#160; Each specialization restricts 
the containment association for a specific component implementation to its respective 
<i>Subcomponents </i>subclass.&#160; The use of the same label for the containment association and its 
specializations permits the contained object to be retrieved by subclass-specific methods as well 
as a generic method of <i>ComponentImpl</i>.</span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The <span><i>CallSequences </i>class represents the calls subclause. It is a concrete 
class which is contained 
in <i>ComponentImpl</i> by a containment association that is specialized for each of the component 
category-specific concrete subclasses of <i>ComponentImpl </i>(see Annex C.4.4).&#160; Each specialization 
determines whether the calls subclause is legal for a specific component category.&#160; The use of 
the 
same label for the containment association and its specializations permits the contained object to 
be retrieved by subclass-specific methods as well as a generic method of <i>ComponentImpl</i>.</span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The reference association between the component implementation and its component type 
represents a <span><i>component type inheritance</i> relationship.&#160; Similarly, the reference association 
between 
a subcomponent and its classifier represents a <i>component type inheritance</i> relationship.&#160; 
This 
means that the features defined in the component type are inherited by component 
implementations as well as by subcomponents.&#160; Component implementations cannot add new 
features. However, its connections can reference these inherited features as well as the features 
inherited by any contained subcomponent from their respective component classifier.&#160; </span><span></span></div>
<div align="left">Such a component type inheritance concept is not a built-in concept of the Ecore meta 
modeling 
capability.  Different from the UML profile for AADL, we have chosen not to replicate the features for 
the component implementation, which would require maintaining consistency of the replicated 
copies and would increase the size of the XML document considerably.  Instead, AADL object 
model processing methods implement the inheritance by returning the appropriate set of features 
when invoked on component implementations or subcomponents.  Feature references, such as 
those of connections, identify the feature object in the component type and the context of the 
inherited feature being referenced (see Annex C.4.8).</div></div>

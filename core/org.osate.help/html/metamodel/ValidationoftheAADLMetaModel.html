     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL meta model has been validated through the construction 
of an Open Source AADL Tool 
Environment (OSATE).&#160; This environment has been built as a set of plug-ins to the Eclipse 
environment and is itself extensible.&#160; OSATE includes an AADL parser that translates textual 
AADL specifications into in-core declarative AADL models.&#160; Those declarative AADL models are 
persistently stored in XML according to the AADL meta model specification.&#160; OSATE also includes 
a semantic checker, various architecture analysis plug-ins, an XML to AADL text translator, an 
AADL object model editor, and an AADL graphical editing front-end. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Other specifications of the AADL meta model are possible.&#160; 
For example, the UML profile of the 
AADL includes a conceptual model of the AADL.&#160; In the case of the UML profile, these concept 
specifications are being kept consistent with the AADL meta model specification in this annex.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The conceptual model of AADL expressed by a collection 
of UML stereotypes and the Ecore meta 
model of the AADL differ primarily in how they represent the different forms of inheritance present 
in 
AADL.&#160; In AADL, component implementations inherit features from component types.&#160; Component 
types can inherit features from component types they extend.&#160; Similarly, component 
implementations that extend other component implementations inherit subcomponents, 
connections, and other elements.&#160; Finally, AADL has a rich set of inheritance rules for property 
values.&#160; The Ecore AADL meta model takes advantage of these different forms of inheritance by not 
replicating inherited objects of an AADL model.&#160; Instead, the AADL inheritance is part of the 
interpretation semantics of the AADL meta model.&#160; This has the benefit of compact models and 
XML documents.&#160; The interpretation of the different forms of AADL inheritance is realized through 
a 
library of AADL object model methods.&#160; In other words, tools that operate on AADL models can 
utilize these methods to access component type features from a component implementation or to 
retrieve a property for a component instance whose value has been declared for the component 
type of the instance.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The UML profile of the AADL offers the possibility of 
a UML-based XML interchange representation 
for AADL models.&#160; The XML schema and the XMI meta model specification for the AADL have been 
defined independent of such a UML-based XML interchange representation such that tool 
developers are not required to embrace UML and its interchange specification in order to support 
AADL-based architecture analysis and generation capabilities.&#160; The alignment of the conceptual 
model in the UML profile with the AADL meta model allows for a simple translation between the 
AADL XML documents and UML-based XML documents of AADL models.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The abstract <i>Connection </i>class represents a connection 
declaration of a connection between 
features of subcomponents, and between features of subcomponents and features of the enclosing 
component implementation.&#160; In the latter case, the connection may refer to a feature in the port 
group type of a port group in the enclosing component implementation.&#160; These classes are shown 
in Figure 23.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A connection has a source and a destination reference 
to features.&#160; These references must 
accommodate for the fact that the features of subcomponents, component implementations, and of 
port groups are inherited.&#160; This is achieved by a reference association to the feature as it is 
contained in the component type or port group type, and a reference association to the context in 
which the feature is referenced.&#160; This context is represented by the <i>FeatureContext </i>class 
- a super 
class that has <i>ComponentImpl</i>, <i>Subcomponent</i>, and <i>PortGroup</i> as subclasses.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The concrete classes that are subclasses of the <i>Connection</i> 
class represent the connection 
declaration for each of the different feature types. The source and destination reference 
associations are declared for each concrete class to reflect the fact that a connection of a certain 
type can only connect features of the same type.&#160; For example, a data port connection can only 
connect data ports.&#160; The concrete connection classes are <i>DataAccessConnection</i>, 
<i>BusAccessConnection</i>, <i>ParameterConnection</i>, <i>DataConnection</i>, <i>EventConnection</i>, 
<i>EventDataConnection</i>, and <i>PortGroupConnection</i>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>All connection classes are subclasses of <i>ModeMember</i>, 
thus, have an <i>inModes</i> reference 
association to <i>Mode</i> objects. The <i>Connection</i> class also has an <i>inModeTransitions</i> 
reference 
association to <i>ModeTransition</i> objects (see Figure 28) to reflect the fact that connections can 
be 
specified to be active during mode transitions.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The source and destination reference associations are 
uni-directional, i.e., a connection refers to a 
port, but a port does not persistently maintain a reference to its connections. &#160;Methods simply 
determine the connections from and to subcomponent ports, i.e., connections to other 
subcomponents or the enclosing component implementation, from the set of connections of the 
enclosing component implementation. Similarly, the connections going from and to a port of a 
component implementation to one of its subcomponents, is the subset of connections of the 
component implementation that has the port as a source or destination reference. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A parameter connection cannot only refer to parameters, 
but also to data and event data ports. 
This is represented in the meta model by the <i>ParameterEnd</i> class with the <i>Parameter</i> class, 
<i>DataPort</i> and <i>EventDataPort</i> class as subclasses.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><br/>
</div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 25 Access Connections</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Figure 25 shows the classes and associations for access 
connections.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Bus and data access connections cannot only refer to 
access features as well as to data or bus 
subcomponent declarations. This is represented in the AADL meta model by the <i>DataAccessEnd</i> 
and <i>BusAccessEnd</i> classes with the appropriate access feature and category-specific 
subcomponent as subclasses.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The context of a connection source and destination reference 
is represented the same way as for 
port connections.&#160; Since at this time AADL does not support access features inside port groups, 
only subcomponents and component implementations are referenced as context in the case of 
parameter and access connections.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

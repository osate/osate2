     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A UML class diagram notation has been used to graphically 
present the Ecore meta model of 
AADL (see Figure 2).&#160; Classes are distinguished from other symbols by a little table-like icon 
in the 
upper left corner. A hierarchy of <i>abstract</i> and <i>concrete</i> classes is used to represent the 
different 
object classes of an AADL model.&#160; Concrete classes can be instantiated into AADL model objects. 
&#160;Abstract classes represent characteristics that are common to a group of AADL model objects. 
For example, the abstract class <i>NamedElement</i> represents AADL model objects that have a name. 
&#160;A line with a hollow triangle denotes a sub class super class relationship and points to the super 
class.&#160; Abstract classes are marked with the letter A in the upper left corner.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic4NotesImage3.jpg" align="bottom" width="154" height="126" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 2 Meta Model Class Notation</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Classes in the meta model can also contain attributes, 
i.e., typed name value pairs. The attribute 
values can be of a number of predefined types or can be enumeration literals of user-defined 
enumerations. Figure 2 shows a multi-valued comment attribute and a single-valued name attribute. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Objects in an AADL model are related to each other through 
two types of associations: a 
<i>containment association</i>, and a <i>reference association</i>.&#160; A containment association 
specifies that 
one object is part of another object.&#160; The UML symbol for composition aggregation, i.e., a line 
with 
a diamond at the container end and an open arrowhead at the contained end, is used to represent 
containment associations (see the<i> </i>containment of<i> ProcessSubcomponents </i>in<i> ProcessImpl</i> 
in 
Figure 3).&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A reference association specifies that objects are accessible 
from other objects.&#160; Reference 
associations can be unidirectional, i.e., one object can access another object, or bi-directional, 
i.e., either object can access the other object.&#160; Unidirectional reference associations are shown 
as 
a line with an arrowhead and a label at the destination, the UML symbol for unidirectional 
associations (see the reference from <i>ProcessSubcomponent</i> to <i>ProcessClassifier</i> in Figure 
3).&#160; Bi- 
directional reference associations are shown as a line without an arrowhead and labels on both 
ends, the UML symbol for bi-directional associations (see the reference between <i>ProcessType</i> and 
<i>ProcessImpl</i> in Figure 3).&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>For bi-directional reference associations, the reference 
to another object is kept consistent with the 
reference in the opposite direction.&#160; If one of the labels of a bi-directional reference association 
is 
marked with a (T), then references in this direction are transient, i.e., not persistently stored in 
XML.&#160; On loading an XML document, the reference marked as transient is re-established for the in- 
core representation.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Both containment and reference associations can have 
a multiplicity to specify the number of 
association instances. Figure 3 shows a containment association between <i>ProcessImpl</i> and 
<i>ProcessSubcomponents</i>.&#160; The association indicates that a process implementation can contain 
zero or one process subcomponents subclause objects.&#160; Figure 3 also shows a unidirectional 
reference association from a process subcomponent to a process classifier and indicates that the 
classifier reference is optional, i.e., zero or one.&#160; For the bi-directional reference association 
between process types and process implementations, the reference from the implementation to the 
type is required to be one and is stored persistently, while the reference from the type to the 
implementations is zero or more and is maintained only in-core. </span></font><span></span></div>

<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 3 Containment and Reference Associations</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Reference associations between classes may be marked 
with an S for <i>specialize</i> (see Figure 4) if 
one or both are abstract classes.&#160; Subclasses of these abstract classes specify specializations 
of 
this reference that restrict the endpoints of the reference to the objects of the classes involved in 
the specialized associations. For example, the reference association between <i>ProcessType</i> and 
<i>ProcessImpl</i> in Figure 3 limits the reference to implementations and types of processes.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>

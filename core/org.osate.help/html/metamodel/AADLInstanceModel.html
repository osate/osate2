     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The <i>Instance</i> meta model package defines the representation 
of an AADL instance model.&#160; The 
instance representation has been designed with several objectives:</span></font><span></span></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>The 
ability to generate instance models from the declarative AADL model with a system 
implementation as the instance root.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>The 
ability to process an instance model without necessarily loading the complete declarative 
model. In other words, caching of property values that are relevant to a particular analysis or 
generation process in the instance model.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>The 
ability to represent a modal AADL instance model without necessarily creating a separate 
instance model for each mode combination, i.e., for each system operation mode as defined in 
section 11.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>The 
ability for tools that operate on the instance model to attach their results as properties of 
the instance model and have the property values be specific to each system operation mode.</span></font><span></span></li>
</ul>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The meta model for the AADL instance model is shown in 
the next three figures.&#160; Figure 35 shows 
the class hierarchy of instance model object classes.&#160; Figure 36 illustrates the relationships 
between AADL instance model objects.&#160; Figure 37&#160; specifies classes that permit AADL instance 
model configuration information to be separately maintained.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The <i>InstanceObject</i> class is the common super class.&#160; 
It is defined as a subclass of 
PropertyHolder, i.e., all instance objects can contain property associations.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Different subclasses of <i>InstanceObject</i> have references 
to their respective classes in the 
declarative model (see Figure 35).&#160; For example, a <i>ComponentInstance</i> object refers to the 
subcomponent it is instantiated from.&#160; Instance objects other than <i>ConnectionInstance</i> objects 
refer to a single counterpart in the declarative model.&#160; A <i>ConnectionInstance</i> object refers 
to the 
collection of connection declarations that make up the connection instance.&#160; In addition, the 
<i>ConnectionInstance</i> object refers to the collection of <i>ComponentInstance</i> objects that provide 
the 
context of each of the connection declaration.&#160; The context of a connection declaration is the 
<i>ComponentInstance</i> object whose component implementation contains the connection declaration. 
&#160;This context is useful for modal processing of instance models.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The <i>ComponentInstance</i> class represents instances 
of subcomponents from the declarative AADL 
model.&#160; The subcomponent name is stored in the name attribute of the <i>ComponentInstance</i> and 
the category is recorded in the <i>category</i> attribute.&#160; The category attribute permits the 
component 
category to be determined without accessing the subcomponent in the declarative AADL model. 
The reference association to the subcomponent is a cross XML document reference, given that 
instance models and packages of AADL specifications are stored persistently in separate XML 
documents.&#160; Lazy loading of XML documents permits analysis and generation tools to operate on 
instance models without causing the declarative model to be loaded.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span><i>ComponentInstance</i> objects are used to represent 
the full component instance hierarchy of a 
system.&#160; For example, a system instance model may consist of a <i>SystemInstance</i> object that 
contains a <i>ComponentInstance</i> for an application system and a <i>ComponentInstance</i> for a 
execution platform system.&#160; The application component instance contains <i>ComponentInstance</i> 
objects representing processes, which in turn contain <i>ComponentInstance</i> objects representing 
threads in those processes.&#160; Similarly, the execution platform component instance contains 
<i>ComponentInstance</i> objects representing processors, buses, memory, and devices.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic26NotesImage3.jpg" align="bottom" width="353" height="825" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 35 The AADL Instance Model Class Hierarchy</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The definition of the <i>ComponentInstance</i> class 
in the AADL meta model permits a flattened 
instance model to be represented that is populated with only the leaf nodes of the instance 
hierarchy.&#160; This may be desirable if the intermediate components are not relevant for processing 
the instance model.&#160; In the example above, the instance model would consist of a <i>SystemInstance</i> 
object that contains <i>ComponentInstance</i> objects for all the threads, processors, buses, memory, 
and devices, but no intermediate components.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The <i>SystemInstance</i> class represents the instance 
root object that is the result of instantiating a 
system implementation.&#160; The <i>SystemInstance</i> has the constraint that it does not have a reference 
association to <i>Subcomponent</i> although it is a subclass of <i>ComponentInstance</i>.&#160; This 
reflects the 
fact that a <i>SystemInstance</i> is instantiated from a system implementation instead of a 
subcomponent.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Modal component instances, i.e., component instances 
whose subcomponent classifiers have 
mode declarations, contain objects of the <i>ModeInstance</i> class.&#160; Component instances also 
contain 
objects of the <i>FeatureInstance</i> class.&#160; The <i>FeatureInstance</i> class has a containment 
association 
to itself to support the representation of nested features in port groups. The feature name is stored 
in the name attribute of the <i>FeatureInstance</i> and the feature category is recorded in the <i>category</i> 
attribute.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The abstract <i>ConnectionInstance</i> class and its 
subclasses represent semantic connections. 
<i>PortConnectionInstance</i> objects represent semantic connections between ports and port groups.&#160; 
If 
the ultimate source or ultimate desintation of the semantic connection is a port group, then the 
semantic connection is unfolded into separate semantic connections for each of the event, data, 
and event data ports contained in the port group.&#160; <i>ModeTransitionConnectionInstance</i> objects 
represent semantic connections from event ports as ultimate sources to mode transitions. 
<i>AccessConnectionInstance</i> objects represent a semantic connection from the data or bus 
component to being accessed to a thread, device, memory, or processor requiring access to data 
or a bus.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>It may be desirable to instantiate incomplete system 
models, i.e., system models where the 
application is not yet elaborated down to the thread level.&#160; For example, it may be desirable to 
perform flow related latency analysis on partitioned systems without the details of partition 
implementations. In this case, the component hierarchy is instantiated for subcomponents with 
classifiers and <i>ConnectionInstance</i> objects may be created between the leaf nodes of this 
incomplete system hierarchy. In this case, a <i>ConnectionInstance</i> object may not have a thread, 
processor, or device as its ultimate source or destination, thus, does not represent a semantic 
connection as defined in Section 9 of the AADL standard. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Flows are represented in AADL instance models as follows.&#160; 
The <i>FlowSpecInstance</i> class 
represents flow specifications associated with a component instance.&#160; The <i>EndToEndFlowInstance</i> 
class represents an end-to-end flow specification in the AADL instance model.&#160; They consist of 
a 
sequence of <i>FlowElementInstance</i> objects that alternate between a reference to a 
<i>FlowSpecInstance</i> object and a <i>PortConnectionInstance</i> object.&#160; <i>EndToEndFlowInstance</i> 
objects 
are contained in the component instance, whose component implementation contains the end-to- 
end flow declaration.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic26NotesImage5.jpg" align="bottom" width="488" height="812" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 36 The AADL Instance Model Relationships</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The paths declared by reference values of properties 
are expressed relative to the component for 
which the property association is declared.&#160; However, through the contained property association 
declaration the property value is actually associated with a component within the hierarchy below 
the component with the declaration.&#160; When property values are cached in the instance model they 
are attached to the instance object for which they are declared.&#160; Since all <i>InstanceObject</i> 
objects 
are property holders, the property association representation from the declarative AADL model can 
be used, except that the reference values have to be translated into references within the instance 
model.&#160; This is done through the <i>InstanceReferenceValue</i> class.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>When property values are cached from the declarative 
model in the instance model, the property 
association has its <i>derived</i> attribute set to true.&#160; The property value of the property association 
is 
the value retrieved from the declarative model.&#160; A copy of the cached property value is attached 
to 
each instance object for which the property value holds.&#160; In other words, in the instance model 
the 
property value is found with the instance object and does not have to be searched for according to 
the rules for determining a property value as defined for property associations in the SAE AADL 
standard.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The <i>SystemOperationMode</i> class represents a system 
operation mode, i.e., a set of current modes 
of all active modal component instances.&#160; It is expressed as a multiplicity reference association 
to 
the relevant <i>ModeInstance</i> objects of modal component instances. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>All valid system operation modes can be generated and 
attached to the system instance through a 
containment association.&#160; This allows analysis tools to iterate over the system operation modes 
to 
analyze the modal instance model.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Several <i>InstanceObject </i>classes represent model 
objects that are active in certain modes as 
expressed by the <i>in modes</i> clause.&#160; <i>ComponentInstance</i> objects are active in modes 
defined by 
the containing component instance.&#160; This is represented by the reference association <i>inModes</i> 
between <i>ComponentInstance</i> and <i>ModeInstance</i>.&#160; <i>ConnectionInstance</i> objects are 
active in 
combinations of modes of components whose connection declarations make up the connection 
instance.&#160; This mode combination is represented by <i>SystemOperationMode</i> objects.&#160; A 
reference 
association <i>inSystemOperationModes </i>between the <i>ConnectionInstance</i> and <i>SystemOperationMode 
</i>records this reference.&#160; <i>EndToEndFlowInstance</i> objects are active in modes defined by 
the 
containing component instance, which is recorded by an <i>inModes</i> reference association between 
<i>EndToEndFlowInstance</i> and <i>ModeInstance</i>.&#160; The system operation modes an end-to-end 
flow 
instance applies to is determined by these modes and the system operation modes that apply to 
each of its flow element instances.&#160; That set can be pre-calculated and recorded through the 
<i>inSystemOperationModes</i> reference association between <i>EndToEndFlowInstance</i> and 
<i>SystemOperationMode</i>.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic26NotesImage6.jpg" align="bottom" width="575" height="204" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 37 System Instance Configurations</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>A <i>SystemInstanceConfiguration</i> class has been defined 
to compactly represent different modal 
system configurations as a combination of a <i>SystemOperationMode</i> objects and property 
associations specific to those system operation modes.&#160; The property associations are contained 
property associations that apply to specific objects in the AADL instance model.&#160; This allows 
analysis tools to record their results in a more compact persistent form and can then be mapped 
onto the instance model.&#160; Multiple sets of of property values can be mapped to the same instance 
model. </span></font><span></span></div></div>

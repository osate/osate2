     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This annex defines the AADL meta model and XML-based 
interchange formats for AADL models.&#160; 
The AADL meta model defines the structure of AADL models, i.e., an object representation of 
AADL specifications that corresponds to a semantically decorated abstract syntax tree.&#160; The 
object representation of AADL models can be manipulated programmatically through an API.&#160; The 
object representation of AADL models can also be persistently stored as XML documents in a 
standard interchange format.&#160; This permits different tools that support the AADL XML schema [XML 
2001] or XMI meta model specification [XMI 2003] to interoperate on AADL models.&#160; Both the XML 
schema and the XMI meta model specification for the AADL are derived from the AADL meta 
model, thus, the two representations are consistent with the meta model.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left">The three model representations and persistent XML formats of AADL models <font face="Helvetica"><span>defined 
in this annex 
are</span></font><span>:</span><span></span></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>A <i>declarative 
AADL model</i>: AADL specifications in the form of component types, component 
implementations, port group types, annex libraries, packages, and property sets.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>An <i>AADL 
instance model</i>: A compact representation of a system instance whose root is a 
system implementation in an AADL specification. This model contains AADL properties 
required for further analysis and processing.&#160; Declarative information is accessible, if needed, 
through cross-document references to the declarative model.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-4mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Helvetica;  "><font face="Helvetica"><span>A <i>graphical 
layout model</i>: Layout information for the graphical display of AADL models.&#160; The 
graphical layout representation is associated with AADL models in their declarative model and 
instance model.</span></font><span></span></li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic2NotesImage3.jpg" align="bottom" width="418" height="279" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica"><span><b>Figure 1 AADL Models and Tools</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>Figure 1 shows the three model representations and their 
roles with respect to the textual and 
graphical AADL representation as well as to tools that process and analyze AADL models. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The declarative AADL model reflects AADL specifications 
and supports translation to and from the 
textual AADL representation.&#160; A parser translates AADL text into a declarative AADL model.&#160; 
Name resolution, semantic checking and other static analysis can be performed on this in-core 
object model of the declarative AADL model.&#160; The emphasis of the declarative model representation 
is to maintain the declarative structure as defined in the standard.&#160; Derived information such 
as 
features inherited by subcomponents from their component type, subcomponents or connections 
inherited by a component implementation from the component implementation it extends, or 
property values of subcomponents inherited from property associations declared with the 
referenced component type or implementation are not explicitly modeled, but are accessible via 
methods that operate on the model.&#160; Results of such analysis can be recorded in the declarative 
AADL model as property values. This makes analysis results available in a standard format for 
other analysis and for generation tools as illustrated in Figure 1. An XML-to-Text converter can 
reproduce textual AADL from the declarative AADL model.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The graphical AADL model is supported by graphical editing 
tools operating on the declarative 
AADL model and using the graphical layout model to maintain relevant layout information about the 
AADL model.&#160; Graphical presentation of AADL instances is supported in a similar manner.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The AADL instance model reflects an instance of a system 
as an instantiation of the application 
system and the execution platform based on a system implementation as the root of the system 
model. Connections between connections, represented in the declarative model as one or more 
connection declarations, are resolved to semantic connections in the instance model.&#160; The 
declarative AADL model contains information that is relevant to assure the semantic consistency of 
AADL models.&#160; However, this information is often not needed for model analyses and runtime 
system generation.&#160; Therefore, this information is not kept in the instance model, but accessible 
through references from the AADL instance model objects to the model objects in the declarative 
model they are derived from.&#160; The AADL instance model is used in the analyses of system 
instances.&#160; In many cases these analyses require a system model in which application 
components are bound to execution platform components.&#160; Such analysis tools may operate on an 
memory-resident representation of the AADL instance model directly, or they may load an XML 
document into memory as part of the analysis process. Alternatively, filters can convert the XML 
representation into an analysis tool specific representation.&#160; Results from such analysis can be 
recorded as properties in the AADL instance model and mapped back into the declarative AADL 
model as necessary.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>The three models of AADL specifications in this annex 
are described by the AADL meta 
model.&#160;This meta model is the basis of a standard persistent interchange format in XML as well 
as 
the basis of an in-core object model that results from loading an XML-based model into memory.&#160; 
The persistent XML representation is specified by an XMI meta model of the AADL and by an XML 
Schema.&#160; Both these specifications are directly derived from the AADL meta model.&#160; </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Helvetica"><span>This annex provides a mapping from the AADL meta model 
to XML documents as a persistent form 
of AADL models. The annex documents the decisions that went into the definition of the AADL 
meta model. And it provides a summary of the AADL meta model.&#160; The full AADL meta model and 
XML/XMI representations are available in an Appendix.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

<p>This guide covers advanced features that most users won&#39;t ever need to deal with.</p>
<h2 id="managing-contributed-resources">Managing Contributed Resources</h2>
<p>The AADL standard defines several standard property sets, such as <code>AADL_Project</code> and <code>Timing_Properties</code>.  In OSATE these are made available in the workspace as plug-in contributions.  They are literally
provided to OSATE by an Eclipse plug-in.  They are globally available within the workspace, that is you do not need to explicitly copy them into your project to use them.  These contributions are visible in the <code>AADL Navigator</code> under the <code>Plug-in Contributions</code> heading.</p>
<p>Occasionally it may be necessary to &quot;override&quot; a contribution, for example to customize property constant values or to correct errors.  OSATE enables this via the <code>OSATE &gt; Contributed Resources</code> preference pane.  </p>
<p><img src="images/AdvancedOSATEFeatures/ContributedResourcesPreferencePane.png" alt="Contributed Resources Preference Pane"></p>
<p>The top of the pane shows a tree that closely mimics the sub-tree shown below the <code>Plug-in Contributions</code> item in the <code>AADL Navigator</code>.  Selecting an item in the tree shows the Xtext URI of the contributed resource.<br>Double-clicking on an item or pressing the <code>Override</code> button brings up a selection dialog box.  This dialog is used to select an resource in the workspace that will be used to override the plug-in contributed resource.
The overriding resource must have the same filename as the original resource; the selection dialog only shows those files in the workspace that have the same name.  The below selection dialog shows the replacement 
resource for <code>AADL_Project</code> being selected:</p>

<p>When a contributed resource is overridden, the tree marks it as such, and the URI shows the workspace URI of the overriding resource:</p>

<p>To restore an overridden resource to its original contributed URI, select it in the tree and press the &quot;Restore&quot; button. </p>
<h2 id="managing-annex-resources">Managing Annex Resources</h2>
<p>Embedded sub-languages published as AADL annexes extend an AADL model to enhance analysis. Several such annexes have been defined, for example, the error modeling sub-language is used to define error states and fault propagation for an AADL model, and the behavior annex allows modeling of detailed component behavior as a state machine. </p>
<p>Annexes are separate from the core AADL in the following sense: if all annex libraries, subclauses, and annex-related property associations are removed from an AADL model, the resulting model is a valid core AADL model. Also, the different annexes are assumed to be independent of each other. </p>
<p>As different annexes are treated as independent of each other and the core language, it is possible to ignore an annex when processing a model. OSATE supports this by defining a default annex meta-model, parser, and unparser. The default annex meta-model simply stores the source text of an annex library or subclause as a string, and the default parser and unparser are trivial as they donâ€™t process the annex content. This allows processing of AADL models with annex elements even if the plug-ins for a particular annex are not installed. OSATE enables this via the <code>OSATE &gt; Annex</code> preference pane:</p>
<p><img src="images/AdvancedOSATEFeatures/AnnexPreferencePane.jpeg" alt="Annex Preference Page"></p>
<p>Default settings is to use workspace preferences with all annexes turned on. There&#39;s also an option to configure annex settings per each project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Configure Project Specific Settings...</code></li>
<li>Select a project to set a preference for and click ok</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/AdvancedOSATEFeatures/AnnexPerProjectSetting.jpeg" alt="Annex Setting per Project"></p>
<ol>
<li>Click <code>Use project settings</code></li>
<li>Select the annexes that should be turned on for selected project</li>
</ol>

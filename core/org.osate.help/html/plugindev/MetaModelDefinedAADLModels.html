AADL meta model defines the structure of AADL models, i.e., an object representation of
AADL specifications that corresponds to a semantically decorated abstract syntax tree. The
object representation of AADL models can be manipulated programmatically through an API.
The object representation of AADL models can also be persistently stored as XML documents
in an interchangeable manner by different tools that support AADL by adhering to an XML
schema or XMI meta model specification. Both of these are derived from the AADL meta
model. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Three
model representations and persistent XML formats of AADL models have been
identified:</span></font><span></span></div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
<li style="margin-left=-3mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Times New Roman;  font-size= 12pt;  color= #010101;  "><font
face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">A <i>declarative AADL model</i>:
AADL specifications in form of component types,
component implementations, port group types, annex libraries, packages organizing
these declarations, and property sets introducing additional property types, property
constants, and property names.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-3mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Times New Roman;  font-size= 12pt;  color= #010101;  "><font
face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">A <i>graphical layout model</i>:
Layout information for the graphical display of AADL
models. The graphical layout representation is associated with AADL models in their
declarative representation and instance model.</span></font><span></span></li>
<li style="margin-left=-3mm; margin-right=0mm; padding-left=0mm; font-family= Times New Roman;  font-size= 12pt;  color= #010101;  "><font
face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">An <i>AADL instance model</i>:
A compact representation of a system instance whose root
is a system implementation in an AADL specification. This model contains AADL
properties relevant for backend processing. Declarative information is accessible, if
needed, through cross-document references to the declarative model.</span></font><span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Figure
17 shows the three model representations and their relationship to the textual and
graphical AADL representation as well as to tools that process and analyze AADL models. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
declarative AADL model reflects AADL specifications and supports translation from and
to the textual AADL representation. A parser translates text into a declarative AADL model.
Name resolution, semantic checking and other static analysis can be performed on this in-core
object model of the declarative AADL model. Results of such analysis can be recorded in the
declarative AADL model as property values. This makes analysis results available in a standard
format for other analysis and for generation tools as illustrated in Figure 17. An XML-to-Text
converter can reproduce textual AADL from the declarative AADL model.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
graphical AADL model is supported by graphical editing tools operating on the declarative
AADL model and using the graphical layout model to maintain relevant layout information
about the AADL model. Graphical presentation of AADL instances is supported in a similar
manner.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
declarative AADL model contains information that is relevant to assure the semantic
consistency of AADL models. However, this information is often not relevant to backend
analyses and runtime system generation. Therefore, a more compact AADL instance model is
desirable that is tailored to such processing. This AADL instance model is derived from the
declarative AADL model. It is used by analyses of system instances, in many cases analyses
that require a system model in which application components are bound to execution platform
components. Such analysis tools may operate on an in-core object representation of the
AADL instance model directly, or filters convert this representation into an analysis tool specific
representation. Results from such analysis can be recorded as properties in the AADL instance
model and mapped back into the declarative AADL model as necessary.</span></font><span></span></div>

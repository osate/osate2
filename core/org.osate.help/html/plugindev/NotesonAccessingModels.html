AADL meta model defines attributes for classes in the meta model as well as containment
and reference associations between classes. Attributes are pieces of information stored in an
object of an AADL model itself. An example attribute is the  timing attribute of the
<b>DataConnection</b> class in Figure 18. The association  eventConnection is
a <i>containment
association</i> between the <b>Connections</b> and <b>EventConnection</b> class in Figure 18.
The
association  refines is a <i>reference association</i> between two AADL model objects of
the
class <b>EventConnection</b> in Figure 18. Attributes, containments, and references can be single
valued (shown by an indicator of 0..1 or 1), or they can be multi-valued (shown by an indicator
whose upper bound is greater than 1 with * indicating an arbitrary number).</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">EMF
generates a collection of methods for accessing and changing AADL models. The API
for accessing AADL models consists of a collection of  getter methods. These methods
have
the name <b>get</b> and the name of the attribute, containment, or reference to be accessed. For
example, the method <b>getRefines()</b> provides access from an <b>EventConnection</b> object to the
<b>EventConnection</b> object it refines. Reference associations automatically handle references
between objects stored in different XML documents. If an attribute, containment, or reference
is multi-valued, then the multi-value list is returned in form of an <b>EList</b> class.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The
API for changing the model consists of  setter methods. For single values these methods
have the name <b>set</b> and the name of the attribute, containment, or reference to be changed.
For
multi-valued attributes, containment, and references these methods have the name <b>add</b> and the
name of the attribute, containment, or reference to be added to the multiplicity list. The multi-
value list can also be retrieved with the getter method and cleared.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Some
classes have a set of containment associations to concrete classes that represent different
categories of an abstract class. In the meta model shown in Figure 18, the class <b>Connections</b>
contains <b>EventConnection</b> objects, <b>DataConnection</b> objects, etc. under separate
containment associations. As a result, the contained XML elements have tag names that
correspond to the containment label. Although they have separate containment associations,
they represent a collection of connections. An EMF provided method <b>eContents()</b> returns
the
objects of all containment associations of an AADL model object. An EMF feature map has
been specified in the meta model (see [AADL Meta Model Annex]). This feature map
maintains an ordering of all contained objects across the containment associations. This assures
that the order in which connection objects are added to a model is the same order in which
they are returned by <b>eContents()</b>. In the case of a parsed AADL model, this order is the
declaration order encountered in the textual AADL model.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">These
methods are straightforward implementations and strictly follow the structure of the
model. While in many cases these methods are perfectly adequate, we have introduced
additional convenience methods into the API.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

meta model generated getter methods do not understand the inheritance semantics of
AADL. For example, when retrieving the connections in a component implementation, analysis
is often interested in the connections declared in that component implementation together with
the connections defined in any ancestor component implementations. In addition, if an ancestor
connection is refined, only the declaration of the refinement is interesting. However, the meta
model only captures the syntactic structure of the AADL model. The connections referenced
by the <b>Connections</b> model object are thus only those connections declared within the
associated component implementation. We thus have the convention that a normal meta model
<b>get</b> method returns only those elements that are locally declared within a component, and that
an additional <b>getAll</b> method returns all elements that are visible in the component due to
inheritance, taking refinement into account. Be aware that not all <b>getAll</b> methods return
lists:
some attributes are  inheritable via feature refinement, but they instead fill in previously
unspecified information, for example, the component classifier of a subprogram feature.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This
naming convention combines with the previous convention: continuing with the connections
example, <b>ComponentImpl</b> also has the method <b>getAllConnection()</b> that returns an <b>EList</b>
of
<b>Connection</b> objects representing all the connections visible in the component implementation,
including those inherited from ancestor component implementations.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

some cases the meta model has containment or reference associations defined for abstract
classes that are specialized as containment or reference associations with the same label for
concrete subclasses. For example, all the subclasses of <b>ComponentImpl</b> declare a
 subcomponents containment. This abstract containment association is denoted in the
meta
model via a dashed line; see Figure 19. Example specializations of this  subcomponents
containment association are shown in Figure 20: <b>DataImpl</b>&#146;s  subcomponents attribute
refers
to a <b>DataSubcomponents</b> object, <b>ThreadImpl</b>&#146;s  subcomponents attribute refers
to a

EMF does not support  abstract associations and their specializations, no access
methods are automatically generated. Even if the appropriate access methods are added to the
abstract classes&#151;in our example to <b>ComponentImpl</b>&#151;Java 1.4 would complain about
incompatible return types because subclasses cannot refine the return value of a method. In our
case, the return value of the access method <b>getSubcomponents()</b> of the subclass <b>DataImpl
</b>would return <b>DataSubcomponents</b>, but the access method would have to be declared in
<b>ComponentImpl</b> to return an instance of <b>Subcomponents</b>.</span></font><span></span></div>

a few cases a class in the meta model has a reference and containment association where
only one of the two is expected to be set. For example, <b>NumberType</b> has a reference
association  unitsTypeReference and a containment association  unitsType.
These two
associations come about because the AADL syntax allows the declaration of a number type to
either reference a declared units type or specify the unit type in-place within the number type
declaration. Thus to get the unit type from a <b>NumberType</b>, you have to check both
associations and use which ever is non-<b>null</b>. This is verbose and error prone, so the naming
pattern <b>getThe</b> is used to name a single method that returns which ever association is non-null.
For example, <b>NumberType</b> has the method <b>getTheUnitsType()</b>.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

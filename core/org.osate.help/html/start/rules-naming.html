<h1>Style guide</h1>
<p>
The following rules are recommended when using AADL for modeling a system. These are more modeling
guidelines and are not mandatory. However, they are recommended in case you want
to use a consistency naming rules and also want to share your models with other AADL users
that might be used to them.

<H2>Getting started: add new models</H2>
<p>
We assume you created an AADL project, as described in the <a href="create-project.html">previous section</a>.
Then, for adding a model, right click on the project directory (in the <em>Resource</em> or <em>AADL Navigator</em> perspectives)
and select <em>New</em> and then <em>File</em>, as shown in the following picture.
</p>

<p>
Then, enter the file of your project, as shown in the following picture. Please note that the file
name must ends with the suffix <strong>.aadl</strong>. For example, choose the name <strong>mymodel.aadl</strong>,
as in the following picture.

<p>
You can then write your AADL model using the syntax editor, as shown in the following picture.
The tool provides three views:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>The Navigator</strong> (on the left): shows all the resources (files and directories)
	associated with your project.
	</li>
	<li><strong>The Editor</strong> (center): provides the capability for editing
	model using the textual notation.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>The Outline</strong> (right): shows the component hierarchy of the model and a simplified
	overview of all component dependencies. 
</ol>
<p>
Once your are done and you wrote your AADL model, you may want to use validation tools to
check its correctness or analyze your system. Most of the tools work on the <em>instance model</em>
and requires you instantiate your system before proceeding. The <a href="instantiate.html">next section</a>
explains how to proceed.

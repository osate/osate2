<h2>Working with Collections of Projects and Versioning Repositories</h2>
<h3>Working with SVN</h3>
<p>
Eclipse does not support nested projects. 
You cannot even put a project into a folder, 
but you can put a folder in a project. 
That’s what makes the use of SVN a little tricky.
</p>
<p>
You may have organized your projects in your SVN repository by 
creating a folder on the repository and by putting the projects 
that belong together into that folder. When you navigate the SVN 
repository in the SVN Repository Exploring perspective, you see the 
folders and projects with the same icon. 
</p>
<p>
If you select the enclosing folder with the intent to check out all
 projects of that folder, it will create a project with the folder 
 name and then put the actual projects into that “project” as
folders – since Eclipse does not allow projects in projects. You 
will have to open the folders (projects) in the SVN Repositories navigator 
to see which ones contain a .project file (clue that you have an AADL project). 
Those are the entities to be checked out.
</p>


<h3>Using Team Project Sets</h3>

<p>
Eclipse has the concept of Team Project Sets.  
It allows you to define sets of projects and then operate on them together. 
In the AADL Navigator, you select a collection of projects and invoke 
“Export” from the “File” menu. This will generate a project set file, 
which you can store in a special project in your workspace. You can even
 put that project under version control.
</p> 
 <p>
When you want to check out one of the team project sets, you select the 
file and perform an import. This will check out all projects from this set.

<h2>Syntax Rules</h2>
<p>
The following are some basic syntax rules for AADL. 
</p>
<p>
A syntax summary is provided on a <a href="http://www.aadl.info/aadl/documents/AADL%20V2.1%20Syntax%20Card.pdf">AADL V2.1 syntax
 card</a>
</p>
<p>
For a complete and formal definition of
syntax rules, please refer to the AADL standard or the AADL book <a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321888944">"Model-Based Engineering with AADL: An Introduction to the SAE Architecture Analysis &eacute; Design Language"</a>.

<table style="border: 1px solid black;">
<tr>
<td><strong>AADL entity</strong></td><td><strong>Rules</strong></td><td><strong>Examples</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
	<ul>
		<li>start with a letter</li>
		<li>end with a letter or number</li>
		<li>no space or special character</li>
	</ul>
</td>
<td><pre><b>process</b> pr_server</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Component implementation name</td>
<td><ul> <li>component type identifier</li>
<li><dot> (".")</li>
<li>implementation identifier</li></td>
<td><pre><b>process implementation</b> pr_server.one_thread</pre> or <pre><b>process implementation</b> pr_server.multi_threads</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Qualified classifier name</td>
<td>Component types, component implementations, and feature group types are referenced by the qualified name. They are qualified with the package name followed by "::"</li>
</td>
<td><pre>aircraft::hardware::PowerPC.Mhz900</pre> or <pre>DataDictionaries::GlobalDictionary</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nested package names</td>
<td>Package names can be nested, i.e., they can be a sequence of identifiers separated by "::"
</td>
<td><pre>aircraft::hardware</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Property sets</td>
<td>Property set names are single identifiers
</td>
<td><pre>aircraft::hardware</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Matching end</td>
<td>Component types, component implementations, feature group types, packages, and property sets end with the keyword <b>end</b> followed by their name.
<td><pre><b>end</b> aircraft::hardware::PowerPC.Mhz900</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Case sensitivity</td><td>AADL is case insensitive for both keywords and identifiers.</td><td>Identifiers <em>MyHouse</em> and <em>myhouse</em> are the same</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>White space</td><td>space, tab, and newline are considered white space</td><td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comments</td><td>Comments start with "--" and go to the end of the line. You can comment or uncomment multiple lines with the keyboard shortcut <em>"ctrl""/"</td><td><pre>ecu: system HardwarePlatform::cc_mcu; -- processor</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Semicolon</td><td>Semicolons (";") are used as the last symbol (terminator) in a declaration, such as a classifier declaration, a feature declaration, subcomponent declaration, or property assignment.</td>
<td<pre>inport: <b>in event port ;</b></pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lists and commas</td><td>Parentheses �(� and �)� are used to bracket lists. Commas are used as separators between list elements.</td>
<td<pre>t1:<b> thread</b> t <b>in modes</b> ( m1 , m2 ); </pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Comments</td><td>Comments start with "--" and go to the end of the line</td><td><pre>ecu: system HardwarePlatform::cc_mcu; -- processor</pre></td>

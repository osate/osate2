     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">OSATE has an AADL builder that maintains consistency between AADL text files and AADL 
XML files, and propagates any changes to an AADL package or property set that affects other 
AADL text files and AADL XML files in the workspace.  This builder is implemented through 
the Eclipse builder API.  The AADL builder is activated through the AADL Perspective. When 
the AADL builder is activated the project icon has a decorator in the form of the letter “A”. </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="center"><img src="NotesImages/Topic31NotesImage2.jpg" align="bottom" width="356" height="218" border="0" alt="graphic" /></div>
<div align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101"><span><b>Figure 12: The build-related commands in the Eclipse/OSATE “Project” menu.</b></span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Eclipse’s automatic build functionality can be enabled and disabled by selecting the “Build 
Automatically” command in the “Project” menu; see Figure 12.  When the automatic build is 
enabled, which is the standard mode of operation in Eclipse, the workspace is rebuilt whenever 
a file in the workspace is changed.  The builder then regenerates all derived files that are 
potentially affected by the change, i.e., it regenerates “.aaxl” files from “.aadl” files (but, as 
described below, it can also update files in the other direction).</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The “Project &gt; Clean…” command results in a complete rebuild of the workspace or project 
as specified in a subsequent dialog window. The clean command causes all derived files to be 
regenerated and any derived files for which the source does not exist to be deleted.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">If automatic build is not enabled (no check mark next to the menu command), then changes to 
the files are tracked by Eclipse but the builder is not automatically invoked.  In that case the 
“Build All” and “Build Project” commands are enabled in the context menu and can be invoked 
to process all changes that occurred to the workspace or selected project, respectively, since 
the last invocation of a build.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The AADL builder considers a file that has been changed in an editor as the original file when it 
is saved from within that editor.  If the AADL text file has been edited and saved, it is the 
original file.  If the AADL XML file as been edited (by the AADL Object editor or by the 
Graphical Editor) it is considered to be the original file.  If the AADL text is the original file, 
then the AADL XML file is regenerated from the modified AADL text file.  If the AADL XML 
file is the original file, then the AADL text file is regenerated from the modified AADL XML file.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">AADL instance model files are always considered derived from AADL XML files.  This means 
they are regenerated anytime the AADL XML files they are derived from have been updated 
due to edits or regeneration. Currently analysis plug-ins invoked on instance models or 
declarative models are not tracked, thus, not automatically applied to the regenerated XML 
files.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">If an AADL file that contains an AADL specification has been modified, then only that file is 
processed by the builder, since other AADL files cannot refer to items in this file.  This is due to 
the fact that the declared component classifiers are part of the anonymous namespace of an 
AADL specification, and that AADL packages and property sets not stored in individually in 
separate files are not treated as residing in the global namespace.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">If an AADL package or property set in the global namespace is modified, then all AADL files 
in the workspace can potentially be affected and all are rebuilt.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

     <div class="topicTextNotes"><div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">An AADL instance model represents an instantiated system. Such an instance model may 
represent a fully instantiated system, i.e., a system that has been described in AADL down to 
the level of individual threads and individual execution platform elements, or it may represent an 
instantiation of a partially specified system, i.e., a system that has been described in AADL with 
some of the subcomponents or implementations of subcomponents not yet specified.  </span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">In a fully specified instance model, the leaf components of the component instance hierarchy are 
thread, device, processor, bus, and memory component instances. The leaf component 
instances have their features instantiated as FeatureInstances.  Port groups are recursively 
instantiated into their contained features.  Semantic port connections are represented in the 
instance model as PortConnectionInstances between the port instances of these leaf component 
instances.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">In a partially specified instance model, the component instance hierarchy is expanded as much 
as possible, i.e., down to subcomponents with a component type as classifier and either no 
component implementation or a component implementation with no subcomponents or 
subcomponents without classifiers.  The leaf component instances have their features 
instantiated.  PortConnectionInstances are created between the port instances of these leaf 
component instances.  These port connection instances do not represent semantic connections 
as defined in the standard as they do not connect threads, processors, and devices.  However, 
they permit partially specified instance models to be processed as low fidelity models of a 
system.</span></font><span></span></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#010101" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Flow specifications are represented in an instance model through FlowSpecInstances and 
EndToEndFlowInstances.  Both are contained in component instances. An 
EndToEndFlowInstance consists of a sequence of references to FlowSpecInstances of the leaf 
component instances involved in the flow and PortConnectionInstances that represent the flow 
between these leaf components.</span></font><span></span></div></div>

<div align="left"><span><b>OSATE 1.3.0</b></span></div>
This release has been made available in concert with the release of TOPCASED 0.9.0.  OSATE 1.3.0 operates under Eclipse 3.1.2 as well as under Eclipse 3.2 RC4 (Callisto 3.2 RC3).  TOPCASED 0.9.0, i.e., the use of the TOPCASED graphical AADL editor operates only under Eclipse 3.2 due to incompatible changes in the API.
<br>
<br>
<div align="left">OSATE analyses now run as Eclipse Jobs.&#160; For the end user, this means</div>
<div align="left">&#160; (1) A Long-running analysis will show a progress bar</div>
<div align="left">&#160; (2) The analysis will &quot;lock&quot; the Eclipse workspace and prevent other jobs from interfering with them.</div>
<br>
<br>

The AADL Object Editor has a set of commands to navigate AADL models.  They include going from a connection to its source and target, from an instance model element to the declarative model element it was generated from, from subcomponents to their classifier, from component implementations to their type. 
<br>
<br>
Similarly, there are a set of navigation commands to move between the graphical editor, object editor, and text editor, while maintaining the current cursor position. 
<br>
<br>
OSATE now supports user-defined folders inside aadl folder and aaxl folder.  This allows users to organize models into subfolders. The top-level folders aadl and aaxl are still required by OSATE and can be set to user-defined folders for AADL text files and AADL XML files through the AADL Build Path in the Project Preferences.
<br>
<br>
New analysis plug-in for resource budget and allocation analysis. See www.aadl.info for details on this plug-in.
<br>
<br>
Improved Binpacking/scheduling analysis. It will now report the degree of overload when the system is not schedulable. It supports scheduling analysis of 100% utilization (default) and according to rate monotonic scheduling conditions (Processor Scheduling_Protocol => "RMS").
<br>
<br>
<b>Plug-in Development</b>
<br>
<br>
The text editor now has extension points for syntax coloring in support of AADL Annex sublanguages.
AaxlReadOnlyAction has been @deprecated.  It has been updated to run it's actions as jobs, but the new preferred superclass for OSATE analysis actions is AaxlReadOnlyActionAsJob. 
Patch for TOPCASED 0.8 to place auto-created classifiers for subcomponents in the same package as the implementation that contains the subcomponent.

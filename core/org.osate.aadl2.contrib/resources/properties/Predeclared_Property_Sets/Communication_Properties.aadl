property set Communication_Properties is

    --- The <b>Fan_Out_Policy</b> property specifies how the output is distributed to multiple recipients of a port with
    --- multiple outgoing connections.  <b>Broadcast</b> sends to all recipients, <b>RoundRobin</b> to one recipient at a
    --- time in order, <b>Selective</b> sends to one recipient based on data content, and <b>OnDemand</b> to the next 
    --- recipient waiting on a port for dispatch.<p>
    --- Note that <b>Broadcast, RoundRobin, and Selective</b> pass on data and events without queuing it, while
    --- <b>OnDemand</b> requires a queue that is serviced by the recipients. 
    Fan_Out_Policy: enumeration (Broadcast, RoundRobin, Selective, OnDemand) applies to (feature);

    --- The <b>Connection_Pattern</b> property specifies how an individual connection between arrays of ports looks like.
    --- If the property is not set the <b>One_to_One pattern</b> applies.  The outer list has an element for each array
    --- dimension. The inner list specifies one or more patterns for that dimension
    Connection_Pattern: list of list of Supported_Connection_Patterns applies to (connection, flow specification);

    --- The <b>Connection_Set</b> property specifies a list of specific source element and destination element of a
    --- semantic connection by their array indices.         
    Connection_Set: list of Connection_Pair applies to (connection, flow specification);

    Connection_Pair: type record (
        src: list of aadlinteger;
        dst: list of aadlinteger;);

    --- The <b>Overflow_Handling_Protocol</b> property specifies the runtime behavior of a thread when an event arrives and
    --- the queue is full. <b>DropOldest</b> removes the oldest event from the queue and adds the new arrival.
    --- <b>DropNewest</b> ignores the newly arrived event. <b>Error</b> causes the thread�s error recovery to be invoked. 
    --- The default value is <b>DropOldest</b>.
    Overflow_Handling_Protocol: enumeration (DropOldest, DropNewest, Error) => DropOldest applies to (event port,
        event data port, subprogram access);

    --- The <b>Queue_Processing_Protocol</b> property specifies the protocol for processing elements in the queue.
    Queue_Processing_Protocol: Supported_Queue_Processing_Protocols => FIFO applies to (event port, event data port,
        subprogram access);

    --- The <b>Queue_Size</b> property specifies the size of the queue for an event, event data port, of a subprogram
    --- access feature,.  In the case of a subprogram access it represents the queue for remote subprogram calls.
    Queue_Size: aadlinteger 0 .. Max_Queue_Size => 1 applies to (event port, event data port, subprogram access);

    --- The <b>Required_Connection</b> property specifies whether the port or subprogram requires a connection.  If the
    --- value of this property is false, then it is assumed that the component can function without this port or 
    --- subprogram access feature being connected.<p>
    --- The default value is that a connection is required.
    Required_Connection: aadlboolean applies to (feature);

    --- The <b>Timing</b> property specifies the timing of port connections.  By default the interaction is <b>sampled</b>,
    --- i.e., the receiving component samples at dispatch or during execution.
    Timing: enumeration (sampled, immediate, delayed) => sampled applies to (port connection);

    --- The <b>Transmission_Type</b> property specifies whether the transmission across a data port connection is initiated
    --- by the sender (<b>push</b>) or by the receiver (<b>pull</b>).  By default the transmission is initiated by the sender.
    --- A pull transmission type results in data being transmitted at the rate of the receiver.  In the case of event data
    --- port or event ports,  a <b>pull</b> transmission type results in events or event data queued with the sender to be
    --- transmitted upon receiver request.<p>
    --- When associated with a connection the property represents the transmission type the connection expects.  When
    --- associated with a port the property represents the transmission type expected by the port.  When associated with a
    --- bus or virtual bus the property represents the transmission type that is provided by the bus or protocol.
    Transmission_Type: enumeration (push, pull) applies to (feature, connection, bus, virtual bus);

    --- The <b>Input_Rate</b> property specifies the number of inputs per dispatch or per second of data, events, event
    --- data, or subprogram calls. If no <b>Input_Rate</b> is specified the default is one input per thread dispatch.<p>
    --- If no distribution function is specified it is assumed to be <b>Fixed</b>.

        Rate_Distribution => Fixed;] applies to (feature);

    --- The <b>Input_Time</b> property specifies the amount of execution time that can pass after dispatch before the input
    --- is frozen on a given port.  The property value is a pair of <b>Time</b> a time range <b>Offset</b>. The default 
    --- input time is <b>Dispatch</b> with zero  <b>Offset</b>. A typical property value is a time offset in terms of
    --- <b>Start</b>.
    Input_Time: list of IO_Time_Spec => ([Time => Dispatch; Offset => 0ns .. 0ns;]) applies to (feature);

    ---The <b>IO_Time_Spec</b> property specifies the amount of execution time <b>Offset</b> relative to a Time at which
    --- input or output occurs. The value consists of a reference point and time range pair.
    IO_Time_Spec: type record (
        Offset: Time_Range;
        Time: IO_Reference_Time;
    );

    --- The <b>IO_Reference_Time</b> type specifies the time reference point to be used for specifying when input or
    --- output is available.  The reference points are dispatch time (typically with zero time offset), start time (zero 
    --- or more time), completion time (amount of execution time until completion), and deadline (typically with zero time
    --- offset). <b>NoIO</b> indicates that no I/O occurs. Dynamic indicates that, if I/O occurs, the time can be anytime
    --- during execution without specifying a specific offset relative to start or completion time.
    IO_Reference_Time: type enumeration (Dispatch, Start, Completion, Deadline, NoIO, Dynamic);

    --- The <b>Output_Rate</b> property specifies the number of outputs per dispatch or per second of data, events, event
    --- data, or initiations of subprogram calls.  The default is one output per thread dispatch and the default
    ---  distribution is <b>Fixed</b>.

    --- available. The property value is a pair of <b>Time</b> and <b>Offset</b>. The default <b>Output_Time</b> is
    --- <b>Completion</b> with zero  <b>Offset</b>. For data ports with a delayed connection the default output time is
    --- <b>Deadline</b>.
    Output_Time: list of IO_Time_Spec => ([Time => Completion; Offset => 0ns .. 0ns;]) applies to (feature);

    --- The <b>Rate_Spec</b> type specifies the number of input or output occurrences per <b>Rate_Unit</b>, i.e., per
    --- dispatch or per second. The default <b>Rate_Distribution</b> is <b>Fixed</b>.  
    Rate_Spec: type record (
        Value_Range: range of aadlreal;
        Rate_Unit: enumeration (PerSecond, PerDispatch);
        Rate_Distribution: Supported_Distributions;
    );

    --- The <b>Subprogram_Call_Rate</b> property specifies the number of subprogram calls per dispatch or per second.  The
    --- default is one call per thread dispatch and the default distribution is <b>Fixed</b>.   
    Subprogram_Call_Rate: Rate_Spec => [Value_Range => 1.0 .. 1.0; Rate_Unit => PerDispatch;
        Rate_Distribution => Fixed;] applies to (subprogram access);

    --- The <b>Transmission_Time</b> property specifies the parameters for a linear model for the time interval between the
    --- start and end of a transmission of a sequence of N bytes onto a bus.  The transmission time is the time between the
    --- transmission of the first bit of the message onto the bus and the transmission of the last bit of the message onto
    --- the bus.  This time excludes arbitration, queuing, or any other times that are a function of how bus contention and
    --- scheduling are performed for a bus.<p> 
    --- The associated expressions must evaluate to a record of two ranges of nonnegative numbers.<p>
    --- The time required to transmit a message of N Bytes over the bus is <b>Fixed + N * PerByte</b>, where <b>Fixed</b> 
    --- is any number that falls in the range of the <b>Fixed</b> record field  and <b>PerByte</b> is any number that falls
    --- in the range of the <b>PerByte</b> record field.  
    Transmission_Time: record (

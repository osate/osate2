/**
 * Interface used to receive notifications regarding diagram modifications.
 * The notifier may not provide notifications for each change. Instead, the caller will notifier will notify after a sequence of related
 * changes have been made. For example, if an element is added and then a series of updates is performed on that element, only a single added
 * notification should be provided. This allows a more fully initialized element to be provided to listeners and prevents unnecessary notifications.
 *
 * Notifications are not guaranteed to be sent immediately after a change is made. Element change notifications will be sent before
 * {@link #beforeModificationsCompleted(BeforeModificationsCompletedEvent)} is called.
 *
 * However, multiple notifications of an element may be sent if other elements are updated between updates of the original element.

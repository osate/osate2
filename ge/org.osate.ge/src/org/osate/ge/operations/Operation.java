 * Represents an operation. An operation is a sequence of steps. An operation may branch into additional sequences of steps.
 * Steps may modify the model, prompt the user, or perform other operations. The result of the previous step is provided to the followings step.
 * Operations provide a means to perform relatively complex model operations while abstracting how the details regarding how the model
 * is accessed.
 *
 * Operations are important for allowing complex operations using a minimal number of transactions.
 * Operations typically perform any user prompting at the start of the operation to allow the operation to abort before
 * any modifications occur.
 *
 * If an operation contains many modifications, the underlying implementation may aggregate modifications to reduce
 * the number of times the model is locked.

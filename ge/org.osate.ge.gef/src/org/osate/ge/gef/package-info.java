/**
 * Contains JavaFX nodes used for rendering diagrams.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.osate.ge.gef.ContainerShape}, {@link org.osate.ge.gef.DockedShape}, {@link org.osate.ge.gef.ConnectionNode}, and
 * {@link org.osate.ge.gef.FlowIndicatorNode} are container node types which do not have any inherent graphical representation. They are designed to
 * represent a diagram element. They are used as containers for a diagram element's graphic, labels, and children.</p>
 *
 * <p>This package contains graphic nodes such as {@link org.osate.ge.gef.EllipseNode}. These nodes are responsible for how graphics are shown and scaled
 * within the diagram.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link org.osate.ge.gef.FxStyle}, {@link org.osate.ge.gef.FxStyleApplier}, {@link org.osate.ge.gef.StyleRoot}, and {@link org.osate.ge.gef.Stylable}
 * are responsible for handling how styles are applied to the scene graph.</p>

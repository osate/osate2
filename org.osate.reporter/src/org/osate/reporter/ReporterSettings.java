/**
 * Each instance of this class contains user preferences as to how the report generator
 * should group, sort, and filter markers.  It also specifies what should be displayed in the summary.
 * Objects of this class are instanciated by an int array, a boolean array, and a HashSet of Strings.
 * 
 * <p>The int array should consist of 6 elements specifying the grouping and sorting prefferences.
 * When filling the array use the constants <code>GROUP_BY_FIELD</code>, <code>SORT_GROUPS_BY_FIELD</code>, <code>SORT_MARKERS_BY_FIRST</code>,
 * <code>SORT_MARKERS_BY_SECOND</code>, <code>SORT_MARKERS_BY_THIRD</code>, and <code>SORT_MARKERS_BY_FOURTH</code> to specify the cell of the
 * array and set it with one of the constants <code>DEFAULT</code>, <code>GROUP_BY_FILE</code>, <code>GROUP_BY_TYPE</code>, <code>SORT_BY_SEVERITY</code>,
 * <code>SORT_BY_MESSAGE</code>, <code>SORT_BY_LOCATION</code>, <code>SORT_BY_MARKER_TYPE</code>, <code>SORT_BY_FILE_NAME</code>, <code>SORT_BY_FILE_TYPE</code>.
 * 
 * <p>The boolean array should consist of 7 elements specifying what should be shown in the summary.
 * When filling the array use the constants <code>SHOW_SEVERITY_FIELD</code>, <code>SHOW_NUM_OF_TEXT_AND_OBJECT_FILES</code>,
 * <code>SHOW_NUM_OF_FILES</code>, <code>SHOW_NUM_OF_TYPES</code>, <code>SHOW_NUM_OF_MARKERS_PER_FILES</code>, <code>SHOW_NUM_OF_MARKERS_PER_TYPE</code>,
 * and <code>SHOW_TOTAL_NUM_OF_MARKERS</code> to specify the cell of the array and set it with true or false
 * depending on whether you want to show the specific element in the summary.
 * 
 * The HashSet should contain all the problem marker types that are to be excluded from the report.  The marker types are to be specified by
 * their unique identifier.  For example: to exclude the Java Problem Marker, include in the set the String "org.eclipse.jdt.core.marker".
 * To display all marker types in the report, pass null to the constructor instead of a HashSet.
 * 
 * <p>The class is Serializable so that it can be saved to disk by <code>ReporterSettingsFrame</code> and read by
 * <code>{@link org.osate.reporter.Reporter Reporter}</code>.

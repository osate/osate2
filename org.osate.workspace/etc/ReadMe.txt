The antlr.jar file is incorporated into the plug-in and reexported to the 
rest of the plug-ins.  See <http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/PDE> for how to
do this properly.

I'm not 100% certain of the version of this antlr.jar.  I think it is the
same version of the antlr.jar files used by version 4.1.1 of the org.antlr.ui
eclipse plug-in that we use to generate the AADL parser.

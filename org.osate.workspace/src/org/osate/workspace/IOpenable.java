/**
 * Common protocol for Java elements that must be opened before they can be
 * navigated or modified. Opening a textual element (such as a compilation unit)
 * involves opening a buffer on its contents. While open, any changes to the
 * buffer can be reflected in the element's structure; see
 * <code>isConsistent</code> and <code>makeConsistent(IProgressMonitor)</code>.
 * <p>
 * To reduce complexity in clients, elements are automatically opened by the
 * Java model as element properties are accessed. The Java model maintains an
 * LRU cache of open elements, and automatically closes elements as they are
 * swapped out of the cache to make room for other elements. Elements with
 * unsaved changes are never removed from the cache, and thus, if the client
 * maintains many open elements with unsaved changes, the LRU cache can grow in
 * size (in this case the cache is not bounded). However, as elements are saved,
 * the cache will shrink back to its original bounded size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To open an element, all openable parent elements must be open. The Java model
 * automatically opens parent elements, as it automatically opens elements.
 * Opening an element may provide access to direct children and other
 * descendants, but does not automatically open any descendents which are
 * themselves <code>IOpenable</code>. For example, opening a compilation unit
 * provides access to all its constituent elements, but opening a package
 * fragment does not open all compilation units in the package fragment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

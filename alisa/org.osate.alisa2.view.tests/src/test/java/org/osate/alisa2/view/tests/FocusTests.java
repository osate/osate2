	 * Discuss testing strategy with Lutz. Specifically, for something like
	 * focus testing, do we still really want to use Sirius? It would be easier
	 * and faster to just write normal unit tests for these.
	 *
	 * It's basically a tradeoff between slow, clunky tests and distance
	 * between what's measured and what the user actually sees.

	 * Lutz says that we may want to split this:
	 * * Some tests should be written to test the java directly / more quickly
	 * * But sirius / swtbot should be used for logic embedded in the odesign file and
	 * for minimal testing of the whole thing (ie, integration / system level tests)

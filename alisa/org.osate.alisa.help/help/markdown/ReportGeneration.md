# Report Generation
ALISA provides the ability to generate report documents with information related to the requirements for an AADL model.  These reports can be produced in a variety of formats including Word Document, Excel Spreadsheet, PowerPoint Presentation, PDF, HTML, and others.  Currently, there are two types of reports: **Requirements Tracing** and **Requirements Report**.

## Selecting the Report Type
The report type can be chosen by right clicking on an appropriate file or object in the **AADL Navigator**, then selecting the **Report Generation** sub-menu.  **Requirements Tracing** will be enabled if the selection in the **AADL Navigator** is an *Instance File*, a *ReqSpec File*, a *Goals File*, a *ReqDoc File*, a *GoalDoc File*, or an *AADL Package File*.  **Requirements Report** will be enabled if the selection in the **AADL Navigator** is a *ReqSpec File*, a *ReqDoc File*, or a *Component Classifier* within an *AADL Package File*.

## Requirements Tracing
When selecting **Requirements Tracing**, a dialog opens which allows for some customization of the report.  Depending on the selection in the **AADL Navigator**, you may be able to select which information is presented in the report.  The first option shows all of the *Stakeholder Goals* with their corresponding *Stakeholders*.  The second option shows all of the *System Requirements* with their corresponding *Stakeholder Goals*.  If a *Goals File* or a *GoalDoc File* was selected in the **AADL Navigator**, then the report will only show all *Stakeholder Goals* with their corresponding *Stakeholders*.  If a *ReqSpec File* or a *ReqDoc File* was selected in the **AADL Navigator**, then the report will only show all *System Requirements* with their corresponding *Stakeholder Goals*.

The dialog also requires that an output file is specified.  Click the **Browse...** button to choose where to save the report and what its format should be.

If **Open Generated Report** is selected, then the generated report will be opened for viewing either within OSATE or by an external application.

The following is an example of a **Requirements Tracing** report:

## Requirements Report
The **Requirements Report** will list all of the requirements associated with the selected object from the **AADL Navigator**.  The customization dialog is similar to the one for **Requirements Tracing**.  The following is an example of a **Requirements Report**:

New features:

End-to-end flow latency analysis now also produces a record of its computation as a CSV file in the reports folder.

Port connection consistency checking: checks whether both ports of a port connection instance have the same Source_Data_Size.

Resource budget analysis now rolls up thread period and execution times to compare against MIPS budgets.


Fixed bugs:
Addressed exception in instance model generation when thread contains data subcomponent that is accessed by subprogram call
via data access connection.

The grammar now allows multiple annex subclauses for the same component type. It checks that they are not for the same annex.

Fixed false report about type matching of port group connections.

Fixed problem with binpacker and model that has both bus access connections and data access connections.

Source_Data_Size is now allowed on ports. Before it was only via data component types.

Scheduling analyzer now provides message if nothing was to be analyzed.

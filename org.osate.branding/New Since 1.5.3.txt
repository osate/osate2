Fixed a problem with subcomponents referring to a component type or an implementation
without flow implementations for its flow specs (Bugs 745 and 768).

Fixed a problem with end-to-end flows that was causing an exception (Bug 763).

Fixed a problem with checking that a connection's destination matches the next element
in an end-to-end flow (Bug 766).

Contained property association can now be used with end-to-end flows (Bug 767).

The model editor now closes when the project containing the open file is closed or the file
itself is deleted (Bugs 747 and 765).

Made the actions 'Goto AADL Text', 'Goto AADL Diagram', and 'Goto AADL Model' consistent
when the opened file is dirty.  They all save the file (Bug 770).

It is no longer enforced that a processor type must contain a requires bus access (Bug 772).

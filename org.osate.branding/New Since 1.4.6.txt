Bug Fixes
---------

Fixed Bug 676: End-to-end flow instances dropped connection instances if they involved port groups.  
The effect was that end-to-end latency analysis did not include the connection latency.

Fixed Bug 673: There was a problem with using the double quote character in string literals.  The standard specifies that double quote characters can
be represented using two double quote characters.  Example: "not ""too"" bad".  The problem was that the second double quote character encountered
was being interpreted as the end of the literal.  The interpreted literal would be "not " and an error would occur because the parser found a double
quote character instead of a semi-colon.  This has been fixed so that two double quote characters is a legal sequence in a string literal.  Note that
the internal representation of the string is the same as the text entered in the literal.

Fixed Bug 671: The reference to a server subprogram of a thread did not get resolved, if the thread was declared with a thread type only. 
Such a reference is only used in remote subprogram call bindings.

Fixed Bugs 661, 665, 666, 667: There was a problem when opening a project or importing model files.  In these situations, the aaxl files were not being
loaded into memory properly.  This caused numerous side effects.  When opening one of these incompletely loaded files, the editor would be empty.  Also,
unparsing these model files would lead to corrupt aadl source files.

Resource budget analysis
------------------------
This plug-in now treats MIPS, cycletime, and execution time consistently.  
This problem only showed if budget analysis based on MIPS was compared against budget analysis bsaed on thread data.


Performance Impovement
----------------------
Model Instantiation runs faster for very large models.

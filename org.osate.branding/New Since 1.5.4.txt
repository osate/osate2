Changed how contributed property sets are incorporated into the workspace.
Upon launch, OSATE will copy the contributed property sets into a project
called 'Plugin_Resources'.  These property sets are marked as read only.
Instead of shadowing a property set, users can remove the read only flag
from a property set and modify it in place.  There is also a command on
the context menu to revert a property set back to its contributed version.

Support for creating instance models from within the text editor through
the context menu

When double clicking on a marker in the problem view, OSATE now goes to
the text editor by default.  An OSATE preference setting can be used to
change it to go to the Object Editor.

Flow latency analysis now examines some of the bus properties to calculate
connection latency. This is attempted if a connection latency property
does not exist.

Resolved problems with consistently loading predeclared property sets when
some of them are shadowed.

Reduced memory footprint by eliminating situations where references into
an AADL model are explicitly held to track current selection etc.

New feature: the Binpacker resource allocation tool can know also allocate
processes (as partitions) to processors. An entry in OSATE Preferences
controls whether the Binpacker will do the allocation at the thread or
process level.

New analysis: We have added a NetWeight property to the SEI property set
with a unit of “kg”.  An analysis plug-in under “architecture” will total
up all NetWeight property values in an instance model.

Fixed race conditions with AADL builder.  
Added toolbar buttons to explicitly invoke a rebuild and the dis/enable autobuild.

Weight analysis now interprets WeightLimit, GrossWeight, and NetWeight.  
The net weight sums of subcomponents and the component are compared to its gross weight (if specified)
and against the weight limit.

Power Analysis now interprets both PowerBudget and PowerSupply properties on bus access connections
and compares them against the PowerCapacity of the bus. Power contributors to the bus use PowerSupply, 
while power consumers use PowerBudget.

Graphical Editor improvements were made to make it more stable. 
Fixed problem with creating bus access connection from existing model. 
Graphical editor now ensures that identifiers are legal & performs semantic checks.
When double clicking on a subcomponent,the editor now tries to find the diagram 
for the component classifier of the subcomponent instead of creating a nested instance diagram.

Text editor has new commands in context menu to navigate to other parts of model.

OSATE now has a special mode in which classifiers can be moved between packages 
within once instance of the Object (Core) editor.
It will update all references including those of the diagrams. 
You open one .aaxl file and the editor shows all packages and their content.
It allows for drag/drop of classifiers within the editor without loosing references.


NOTE: Analysers use different marker types to report their results in the "Problem View" of Eclipse.
You can get this view to sort the markers by marker type, thus, see all the markers of one analysis together.
Use the "Group by" and "Type" feature of the Problem View from the menu on the top right of the Problem View.

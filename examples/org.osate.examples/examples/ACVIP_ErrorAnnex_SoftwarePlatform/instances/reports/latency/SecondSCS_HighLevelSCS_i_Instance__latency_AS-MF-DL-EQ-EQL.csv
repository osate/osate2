End to end Latency Summary
WARNING,Minimum specified flow latency total 29.0ms less than expected minimum end to end latency 30.0ms (better response time)
WARNING,Minimum actual latency total 29.0ms less than expected minimum end to end latency 30.0ms (faster actual minimum response time)
ERROR,Maximum specified flow latency total 37.0ms exceeds expected maximum end to end latency 30.0ms
ERROR,Maximum actual latency total 37.0ms exceeds expected maximum end to end latency 30.0ms
WARNING,Jitter of specified latency total 29.0..37.0ms exceeds expected end to end latency jitter 30.0..30.0ms
WARNING,Jitter of actual latency total 29.0..37.0ms exceeds expected end to end latency jitter 30.0..30.0ms

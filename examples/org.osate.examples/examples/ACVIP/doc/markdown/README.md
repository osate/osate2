# ACVIP Example

This example is the Sensor Control System (SCS) example presented in the
AADL/ACVIP video tutorial ([available on YouTube](https://youtu.be/UQ9dWhLws-Q)).
It was originally designed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to demonstrate the following
capabilities of OSATE:

* Check Flow Latency

This model can be incrementally built upon to demonstrate multiple levels of
complexity within an AADL model, as well as the ability to run an analysis on
a model early in the development process. As the model becomes more complex,
the same analysis can be rerun to ensure the project is staying on track and 
more analysis will become valuable to be run on the model.

More information on the Architecture Centric Virtual Integration Process (ACVIP)
can be found via a conference paper from [SEI's Digital Library](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=634965). 

This model and README is based on OSATE 2.9.1.

### Organization of the example

There is one model contained within this project, along with a diagram of 
the HighLevelSCS implementation. 

### Creating a diagram

Although a diagram is already contained inside of this example project,
additional ones can be generated. To generate additional diagrams,
open InitialSCS.aadl, right click on the HighLevelSCS implementation in the
Outline perspective and select "Create Diagram...". The resulting diagram may
be somewhat different in appearance to the provided diagrams in the example if
using a newer version of OSATE.

### Conducting analysis

To analyze the model start by right clicking on the HighLevelSCS implementation
in the Outline perspective and select "Instantiate". The instantiation is placed
in the instance folder within the model in the AADL Navigator. Click the
instantiation (e.g., InitialSCS_HighLevelSCS_i_Instance.aaxl2) and then select
the Check Flow Latency (e.g., from the Analyses menu under the Timing submenu).
